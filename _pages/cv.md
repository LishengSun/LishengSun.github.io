I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at LISN, Université Paris-Saclay, since December 2022, with responsibilities in both research and teaching (chargée de recherche et d'enseignement). My current research focuses on AutoML, Meta-Learning, and AI fairness.

Prior to my postdoc, I was a Senior Data Scientist and Research Lead at Crédit Agricole S.A., where I specialized in AutoML, Explainable AI (XAI), and AI fairness for the banking sector.

I earned my Ph.D. in Machine Learning in December 2019 under the supervision of Prof. Isabelle Guyon and Prof. Michèle Sebag, focusing on AutoML and Meta-Learning.

### Ph.D. Machine Learning. Université Paris Sud, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, 2019. 

[Meta-Learning as a Markov Decision Process.](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02422144v2/document)

The success of machine learning applications across various fields depends heavily on the design of effective model architectures, a process that is both time-consuming and requires substantial domain expertise. My PhD thesis focuses on developing a methodology to automate this process, known as AutoML. In particular, we explore the meta-learning aspect of AutoML and formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We propose several solutions to this problem, including approaches based on collaborative filtering and reinforcement learning.

### Master. Astrophysics. Observatoire de Paris, Paris, France, 2011-2013 

The physical properties of local galaxies with high specific star formation rate

Prof. Matthew Lehnert and Prof. Wim van Driel, Institut d’Astrophysique de Paris, Paris, France.

### Bachelor. Physics. Université Paris 7, Paris, France, 2008-2010
